# AgentFlow Conventions

> Version: 2

> Source of truth for the entire AgentFlow pipeline. All skills, prompts, and adapters reference this document.

## Task Naming

```
[CODE-NNN] <verb> <noun>
```

- `CODE` = project code (e.g., `APP`, `API`, `WEB`)
- `NNN` = sequential number within project
- Verb = action (Add, Create, Implement, Fix, Refactor, Configure, Update)
- Noun = what's being built

Examples:
- `[APP-001] Create user authentication flow`
- `[API-005] Add rate limiting middleware`
- `[WEB-012] Fix responsive layout on dashboard`

## Pipeline Stages

| # | Stage | Section Name | Description |
|---|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 0 | Needs Human | 0 - Needs Human | Blocked, cost-critical, or requires manual intervention |
| 1 | Backlog | 1 - Backlog | Ready for dispatch (dependencies may be pending) |
| 2 | Research | 2 - Research | Conditional — gathering external knowledge |
| 3 | Build | 3 - Build | Agent writing code + creating PR |
| 4 | Review | 4 - Review | Adversarial AI review + coverage gate |
| 5 | Test | 5 - Test | Full test suite + visual validation |
| 6 | Integrate | 6 - Integrate | Merge to main + integration check |
| 7 | Done | 7 - Done | Task complete |

## Metadata Header

Every task description starts with a metadata header:

```
[SLOT:--] [STAGE:Backlog] [RETRY:0] [COST:~$0]
```

- `[SLOT:--]` or `[SLOT:T2]` — assigned worker slot (T2-T5, -- = unassigned)
- `[STAGE:X]` — current pipeline stage
- `[RETRY:N]` — number of feedback loop iterations
- `[COST:~$N]` — accumulated cost estimate

## Regex Patterns

All agents MUST use these exact patterns for parsing metadata. Do not write your own.

```
Stage: \[STAGE:(Backlog|Research|Research-Complete|Build|Build-Complete|Review|Review-Complete|Review-Rejected|Test|Test-Rejected|Integrate|Integrate-Failed|Done)\]
Slot: \[SLOT:(--|T[2-5])\]
Retry: \[RETRY:(\d+)\]
Cost: \[COST:~\$(\d+(?:\.\d{2})?)\]
Spec Hash: \[SPEC_HASH:([a-f0-9]{64})\]
Merge Lock: \[MERGE_LOCK:(T[2-5]):([A-Z]+-\d+)\]
Sweep Running: \[SWEEP:RUNNING (\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}T\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2})\]
Last Sweep: \[LAST_SWEEP:(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}T\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2})\]
```

IMPORTANT: Use word-boundary matching for STAGE to prevent substring collisions
(e.g., "Build" must NOT match "Build-Complete").

## Comment Tags

Machine-readable tags posted as Asana comments. The orchestrator and workers parse these to determine state.

### Stage Completion Tags
| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `[RESEARCH:COMPLETE]` | Research finished, findings posted |
| `[RESEARCH:SKIP]` | No research triggers — skipped |

| `[LINT:PASS]` | Deterministic gate passed (tsc + lint + tests) |
| `[LINT:FAIL]` | Deterministic gate failed |
| `[LINT:SKIP]` | Deterministic gate skipped (no tooling configured) |
| `[REVIEW:PASS]` | AI review approved |
| `[REVIEW:PASS_WITH_NOTES]` | AI review passed with non-blocking suggestions |

## Task Description Template

Every task must include these 9 required fields:

```markdown
[SLOT:--] [STAGE:Backlog] [RETRY:0] [COST:~$0]

## Summary
<What this task does — one sentence>

## Input State
<What must be true before this task starts — file states, dependencies met>

## Output State
<What will be true after this task completes — files created/modified, behavior changes>

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] <Criterion 1>
- [ ] <Criterion 2>
- [ ] <Criterion 3>

## Verification Command
<Single command that proves the task works>
```bash
npm test -- --grep "feature-name"
```

## Predicted Files
- `src/path/to/file.ts` (create)
- `src/path/to/other.ts` (modify)
- `tests/path/to/test.ts` (create)

## Dependencies
- [CODE-NNN] <task name> — <why this must complete first>

## Research Triggers
- [ ] Uses unfamiliar library: <library name>
- [ ] Involves external API: <API name>
- [ ] Complex algorithm: <description>
(Empty = no research needed)

## Complexity
<Simple | Medium | Complex>
<Estimated hours: N>
```

## Atomicity Rules

A task is atomic if:

1. It can be built, reviewed, tested, and merged independently
2. It modifies ≤5 files
3. It has a single verification command
4. It produces a meaningful, working increment
5. Its PR can be reviewed in under 15 minutes
6. It doesn't require changes to more than 2 modules
7. Rolling it back wouldn't break other completed tasks

## Cost Ceilings Per Stage

### Sonnet Profile (default, recommended)
| Stage | Without Superpowers | With Superpowers (M) | With Superpowers (L) |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Research | ~$0.10 | ~$0.10 | ~$0.10 |
| Build | ~$0.40 | ~$0.80 | ~$1.20 |
| Review | ~$0.10 | ~$0.10 | ~$0.10 |
| Test | ~$0.05 | ~$0.05 | ~$0.05 |
| Integrate | ~$0.03 | ~$0.03 | ~$0.03 |

Guardrails: Warning at $3, Hard stop at $10

### Opus Profile (for complex projects)
| Stage | Without Superpowers | With Superpowers (M) | With Superpowers (L) |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Research | ~$1.00 | ~$1.00 | ~$1.50 |
| Build | ~$3.00 | ~$5.00 | ~$8.00 |
| Review | ~$0.50 | ~$0.50 | ~$0.50 |

Select profile during `/spec-to-asana` setup. Default: Sonnet.

## Dispatch Priority

Priority is calculated as:

```
priority = count of tasks transitively blocked by this task
```

Higher count = higher priority. This automatically identifies the critical path.

**Tie-breaking:** Earlier task code number wins.

## Worker Slot Assignments

| Slot | Preferred Role | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| T2 | Build/Research | Primary builder |
| T3 | Build/Research | Secondary builder |
| T4 | Review | Dedicated reviewer |
| T5 | Test | Dedicated tester |

- If preferred slot is busy, any available slot is used
- A reviewer must NEVER be the same slot that built the task
- On retry 2+, a DIFFERENT worker than the previous attempt should be assigned

## Research Source Priority

1. **Codebase** (free) — existing patterns, similar implementations
2. **Documentation tools** (e.g., Context7 — no rate limit) — official library docs
3. **Web search** (rate-limited) — blog posts, tutorials, Stack Overflow
4. **GitHub** (opt-in only, 60 req/hr) — reference implementations

## Decomposition Validation

Before creating tasks in the PM tool, the decomposition must pass:

1. **Rubric check**: All 9 required fields present per task
2. **Topological sort**: No circular dependencies
3. **File conflict check**: Parallel tasks don't share predicted files
4. **Atomicity check**: No task modifies >5 files
5. **Verification syntax check**: Every verification command is valid shell

## LEARNINGS.md Management

- Maximum 50 lines / 30 patterns
- When adding new patterns, if file exceeds 50 lines, remove oldest patterns from the top
- Workers read only the most recent 30 patterns (bottom of file) if file is large
- Format: each pattern is exactly: `## Pattern: <name>\n**Frequency:** ...\n**Fix:** ...\n**Added:** ...`

## Plugin Mode

AgentFlow v2 supports two execution modes:

### Standalone Mode (v1 compatible)
- Workers: separate terminal sessions (`claude -p "/sdlc-worker --slot T<N>"`)
- Orchestrator: crontab every 15 minutes
- Communication: Asana comments only
- Gates: prompt-enforced

### Plugin Mode (v2)
- Workers: spawned as agent team via TeamCreate
- Orchestrator: runs as sdlc-orchestrator agent
- Communication: SendMessage (fast) + Asana comments (durable)
- Gates: hook-enforced (lint-gate, coverage-gate, scope-guard)

### Mode Detection
Skills detect mode by checking tool availability:
- `TeamCreateTool` available → plugin mode
- `SendMessageTool` available → plugin mode
- Neither available → standalone mode

### Dual Communication Protocol
In plugin mode, workers use BOTH channels:
1. **SendMessage** for instant handoffs and progress (ephemeral, agent-to-agent)
2. **Asana comments** for structured tags and audit trail (durable, human-visible)

If SendMessage fails, fall back to Asana-only communication. The orchestrator's next sweep recovers from Asana state.

## New Comment Tags (v2)

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `[CONTEXT:OVERFLOW]` | Worker hit context window limit, state posted, needs reassignment |
| `[SCOPE:CRITICAL]` | 3+ unpredicted files, needs human review |

## Updated Gap Registry

Gaps 46-51 address plugin mode failure modes. See `docs/gap-registry.md`.
